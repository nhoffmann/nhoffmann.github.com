Fandangocast was an online tool to generate podcast feeds (technically RSS feeds) from tracks released by the artists you follow on Soundcloud. You could then subscribe to these feeds with your favorite podcasting app and where thus able to listen to those tracks offline, a feature that was at that time not offered by the official Soundcloud app. Unfortunately Soundcloud removed necessary parts of their API, so the project is discontinued.

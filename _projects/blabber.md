Blabber was a free service to record and share voice messages on the web. With its no bullshit UX, during a time where Whatsapp and other messengers did not allow to send voice messages yet, this tool was pioneering and gathered a huge following especially in countries where smart phone use was not prevalent. The project was discontinued in 2016.

Where you looking for a Conway's Game Of Life simulator written in Go? Probably not, but here's one anyway: [https://github.com/nhoffmann/life](https://github.com/nhoffmann/life).
It started as a toy project (it still is), but evolved into something more than just implementing the Game of Life. It ended up to be a
pattern viewer for every possible pattern from the Life like cellular automata.

Features:

* Supports all possible birth and death rules
* The board is infinite
* Load patterns from [RLE](https://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Run_Length_Encoded) files
* Magnification of the board
* Dragging the board to inspect certain areas

You can play around with it here: [https://www.zentralmaschine.net/life/public/](https://www.zentralmaschine.net/life/public/)

I have some ideas on how to improve things. Mainly making the interface easier to navigate and improving the performance.  For now this is fine though and I am happy to be one of those people that implemented a Game Of Life.


2020-04-11 Update: Sadly, news got out that [John Conway has died](https://twitter.com/CardColm/status/1249038195880341505). Even though Game of Life is apparently not the thing he wants to remembered for, I am thankful for his idea. Here is a video of John Conway talking about Game of Life: [https://youtu.be/R9Plq-D1gEk](https://youtu.be/R9Plq-D1gEk)

This is the second time I needed to include [jPlayer](http://jplayer.org) in a [HAML](http://haml.info/) based project. The jPlayer documentation comes with [vanilla HTML examples](http://jplayer.org/latest/quick-start-guide/step-6-audio) and we have to convert them.

Of course, there is a nifty tool that does exactly that for you:

[html2haml.heroku.com](http://html2haml.heroku.com/)

Paste in html and get back haml code. Easy as pie!

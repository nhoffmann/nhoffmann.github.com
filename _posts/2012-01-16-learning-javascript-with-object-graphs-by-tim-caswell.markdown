I just recently stumbled upon this very valuable series of articles explaining Javacript objects, prototypical inheritance, closures and the like in visually appealing fashion. Tim Caswell uses object graphs to make you grasp the subject and that works extremely well.

* [Learning Javascript with Object Graphs I](http://howtonode.org/object-graphs)

* [Learning Javascript with Object Graphs II](http://howtonode.org/object-graphs-2)

* [Learning Javascript with Object Graphs III](http://howtonode.org/object-graphs-3)

I found it in this [blogpost](http://n0tw0rthy.wordpress.com/2012/01/08/from-java-to-node-js/) and although there are some more links, the object graph articles seemed to be the most important ones.

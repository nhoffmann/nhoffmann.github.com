Description:
    This generator is here to help with the setup of grunt / yeoman
    configuration on Jekyll based websites.

    It'll scan the current working directory for key-directories and known file
    patterns. You'll then be asked for confirmation on each of these directory,
    with sensitive defaults, or suggestion based on the current file structure.

    ex. A lookup is performed on the current working directory for CSS (and
    scss/sass files). Each result is then reduced into a list of unique
    directory paths. If the scanned directories consists in a single result,
    then the system suggest to use that path as "styles" value.

    The result is then persisted as a local `.yeomanrc` JSON file, along the
    generation of a Yeoman Gruntfile.

Example:
    yeoman init gruntfile:jekyll

    This will create:
        Gruntfile.js
        .yeomanrc

The "temp" directory is used mostly with the build and server commands.

It acts as a mirror of your "app" directory, compile-ish steps like coffee,
compass or even rjs should be configured to output in this directory.

The server task when creating the HTTP server will use both directories to
serve static files, from both locations. Order matters, and the "app" directory
is usually configured prior to the "temp" one, meaning that the server will
respond with the file in "app" when the same file appears in both direcory.

Additionnaly, this directory is used by the build task, to copy the files in
the "app" dir and optimize files in that temporary directory.

Defaults to `temp/`.

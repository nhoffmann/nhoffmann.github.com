Description:
    Yeoman generator based on @necolas' Jekyll Boilerplate.

    This generator will simply fetch the latest state of jekyll-boilerplate's
    master branch (unless the content is already cached by yeoman at
    `~/.yeoman/cache/necolas/jekyll-boilerplate)` in the `location` argument
    provided.

Arguments:

    - location: Defaults to current working directory. Base directory to copy
                the content of the remote template.

Tasks:

    This generator will also generate:

      - a basic Gruntfile if none were found
      - a tasks/ directory with:
        - server: Override the built-in server command to run Jekyll instead.

Example:

    yeoman init jekyll

    This will create:
        .
